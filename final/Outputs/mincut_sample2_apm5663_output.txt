The weight of the minimum edge-cut is 20.
The vertices on one side of the cut are:
{1, 2, 3}
The vertices on the other side of the cut are:
{4, 5, 6}
The edges of the cut with their weights are:
Edge (1, 5) with weight 3
Edge (1, 6) with weight 4
Edge (2, 6) with weight 5
Edge (3, 4) with weight 2
Edge (3, 6) with weight 6
