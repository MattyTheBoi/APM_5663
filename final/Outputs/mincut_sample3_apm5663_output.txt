The weight of the minimum edge-cut is 6.
The vertices on one side of the cut are:
{1, 7}
The vertices on the other side of the cut are:
{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}
The edges of the cut with their weights are:
Edge (1, 2) with weight 2
Edge (7, 3) with weight 3
Edge (7, 6) with weight 3
Edge (7, 10) with weight 4
Edge (5, 6) with weight 4
