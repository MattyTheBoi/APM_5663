The weight of the minimum edge-cut is 3.
The vertices on one side of the cut are:
{1, 3, 9, 7}
The vertices on the other side of the cut are:
{2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}
The edges of the cut with their weights are:
Edge (1, 2) with weight 2
Edge (1, 4) with weight 3
Edge (7, 6) with weight 3
Edge (7, 10) with weight 4
Edge (3, 2) with weight 5
Edge (3, 8) with weight 3
Edge (9, 8) with weight 7
Edge (9, 10) with weight 6
