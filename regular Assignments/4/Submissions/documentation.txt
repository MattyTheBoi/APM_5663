Power Series Coefficient Finder

Overview

This program reads a power series from a given text file, represented by its coefficients, and computes the first m + 1 coefficients of the k-th power, 
the reciprocal, and the inverse of the given power series f(x) = sum(a_i * x^i) for i = 0 to n. The program outputs whether the reciprocal or the inverse exists, 
and then prints the first m + 1 coefficients of each of the power series f^k(x), 1/f(x), and f^(-1)(x), whichever exists. 
This was done as part of an assignment at Oakland University, APM 5663 in Fall, 2024.

Files

4. The results will be saved in the Outputs directory with filenames corresponding to the input files, appended with _output.

Program Documentation

1. Overview

The program reads a power series from an input file, computes the first m + 1 coefficients of the k-th power, the reciprocal, and the inverse of the given power series. 
The results are written to an output file, including whether the reciprocal and inverse exist, and the coefficients of each series.

2. Key Concepts

- k-th Power: The power series raised to the k-th power.
- Reciprocal: The reciprocal of the power series, 1/f(x).
- Inverse: The inverse of the power series, f^(-1)(x), such that f(f^(-1)(x)) = x.

3. File Format

The input file contains the following information:
1. The first line contains the values of n, k, and m (nonnegative integers).
2. The next n + 1 lines contain the first n + 1 coefficients (a_0, a_1, ..., a_n) of the power series f(x).
